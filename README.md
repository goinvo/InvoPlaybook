# InvoPlaybook

## Develop

### Getting started

This project uses [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). You'll need Node to work with Gatsby.

1. Check if you have node by running this command in your terminal:
    `node --version`
    - If you have Node installed, you should see a message like this:
    `v8.2.1`. In which case, you can move to the next step.
    - If not, you may see an error like: `command not found: node`. In which case you should install node using a tool like brew: `brew install node`.
2. Install Gatsby using Node's package manager, npm: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/goinvo/InvoPlaybook.git`.
    - Or using ssh: `git clone git@github.com:goinvo/InvoPlaybook.git`.
4. Change into the project directory: `cd InvoPlaybook`.
5. Install project dependencies: `npm install`.

### Editing page content

1. Run the project from inside the project directory: `gatsby develop --host localhost`.
2. Observe the playbook on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
3. Edit applicable `.md` files in `src/pages/` directory.
    - Note: All subsections must be started by an h2 element (using ## in Markdown) in order to auto-populate the navigation menu.
4. Observe the changes reflected automatically on localhost.
5. Commit and push the changes.
