## Team

### Rhythm
Meet once a week. 	
Face to face is preferred. 	
For remote meetings, use your preferred communication channel: GoToMeeting, Google Hangout, Skype, Phone. 	
Duration: 1 to 1.5 hours. Adjust as needed.


### Prep
Post deliverables on Basecamp 2 hours prior to meeting or the night before. Some clients review the deliverables in advance and come to the meeting already with feedback. Others use the scheduled time during the meeting to review the latest deliverables. Adjust as needed.
Message structure on Basecamp for deliverables:  
<ul>
	<li>Subject: Deliverable name, version number, and current project week with total weeks (ex.
	'Create Campaign v04 :: Week 5 of 10').</li>
	<li>Message: Describe what’s new in the deliverables, what you’d like to discuss in the meeting, and your next steps as you currently know them.</li>
</ul>

If meeting face to face, then print the deliverables using the large format printer and bring to the meeting. Printed deliverables are helpful for everyone to circle around, discuss, and mark up with feedback. Often, clients will hang these posters in their office for the entire company to have visibility into the design, see progression, and mark up as well ().

### Post Meeting 
Immediately document your notes and post to Basecamp after the meeting. 	
Message structure on Basecamp:

	<li>Message: Document the feedback, any changes in direction or schedule, and re-iterate what you’ll be working on for next week.</li>
</ul>

Take photos of the team and client engaged a few times throughout the project. These will be used to document the project and possibly for marketing.


## Lead
 
### Project Assessment
For each quarter of the project completed, at the end of the meeting do the following with the client:
<ul>
	<li>Provid a high-level of the project status; how we’re doing against the schedule, what we need help with, and if necessary, make any adjustments so we can realistically deliver on time.</li>
	<li>Request stakeholders to critique how Invo is doing, what can be done better.</li>
</ul>
