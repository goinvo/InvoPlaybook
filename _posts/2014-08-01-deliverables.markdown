## Basics

### Naming Deliverable 	
At the bottom of every document, include the client name, deliverable name, version number, Invo team names (alpha order of last name), date (format `19.Feb.15` which InDesign automates for you using the documents last modified date), and Invo logo.

### Numbering and Naming Screens 	
If there are multiple screens or ideas within a page then each screen or idea should be numbered and named appropriately. Numbering helps people identify which comp to look or are referencing on the page. Naming helps people understand what that comp is generally about.

### Annotating Screens	
It's helpful to annotate your documents so others can understand the details behind the images and to guide people through the workflow.

### Comp Template 	
This Adobe InDesign template includes the styles (paragraph + object styles) to mark up deliverables: labels, annotations, and branding.

## Common Deliverables

### Implementation Analysis
Details an estimated effort to build the design we're working on. Includes amount + type of people, time, and releases. Typically created towards the end of the project where we'll have a good sense of the product. This exercise takes about 2-3 days internally and then we'll review with the client and their engineering team. It's expected to have a revision or two based on feedback.

[Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/15a2aktq6btr54q/APS%20Gnosis%20Implementation%20Analysis.pdf?dl=0) 	

### Market Research 	
[TBD](#)

### Needs Map 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mu914vjtjfwqjdy/jnj_icb_needs_map_schizophrenia_v03.pdf?dl=0)

### Pixel Perfect Comps 	
Exact perfection in UI details. These comps will provide guidance and the assets for a UI Engineer to align the software with. Whenever handing PSDs to others, make sure the layers are appropriately named and organized. 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dwd4wayp6bcrtz/dataxu_dxp_design_v08.psd?dl=0) 	
[Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94x17023dtjlvli/Concept_Studio_Design_v35.psd?dl=0)

### Presentations 	
At times, we create specific presentations tailored to the clients needs. Sometimes we present to key project stakeholders, clients customers, or the entire company. 	
[Example 1: Project Progress Summary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sq8phtc1dppcrnu/dataxu_dxp_UI_design_project_v03.pdf?dl=0)

### Process Map
Maps out the process of the service. This could map out all parts of the process, even if we're not designing it, because we should know the entire lifecycle of a person using the service. 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmvx4pj45h1b5bs/mountsinai_caas_process_v03.pdf?dl=0)

### Product Ecosystem
Inventory of all the clients products plus their relationships and overlaps between products. 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxu5ngum8kc4i0v/Empirix_product_ecosystem_v2.pdf?dl=0)

### Product Blueprint
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mkarx47fs8kfbmi/SmashFly_blueprint_v2.pdf?dl=0)

### Project + Product Spec
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpjazxs0yioy5cn/jnj_icb_educational_spec_v02.pdf?dl=0)

### Prototype
A demo of part(s) of the software we're designing. Highly iterative. Each prototype should have a clear intention to test. Prototype formats can vary based on needs but can be: Keynote, Flinto, HTML, Native. 	
[TBD](#)

### Production Code
Using our designs, we'll work with the client to develop the new software. 	
[TBD](#)

### Product Questions
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7id6hvy8u6pmrv3/dataxu_dxp_productquestions_v02.pdf?dl=0)

### Schedule
Every project has a schedule and should be roughly based on the Statement of Work: goals and duration. During the kickoff is where the schedule should be finely detailed with the client. It should state clearly what is delivered each week until the end of the project.
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxvlx1wyeegskw7/dataxu_dxp_schedule_v01.pdf?dl=0)

### Sketches
Sometimes we'll share our sketches if we're looking for quick feedback and have not yet started to digitally create the concepts. 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6cbk379cuuujweq/jnj_icb_patient_careplan_sketches.pdf?dl=0) 	
[Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ygduciwalvqzsm/mountsinai_caas_admin_draft.pdf?dl=0)

### System Diagram
High-level architecting of the main components of the service, relationships, and actions.
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sds8kpjlnvkt02j/mountsinai_caas_systemdiagram_v02.pdf?dl=0)

### Technical Recommendations
[TBD](#)

### UI Workflows
Many of our deliverables are UI Workflows. These show the screens, how people will use the software through a series or screens, and any details to describe the experience. 	
[Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5uusfto3852kdzj/affinnova_conceptstudio.pdf?dl=0) 	
[Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2wpwc3or1spfa7i/coderyte_hsc_encounterworkflow.pdf?dl=0) 	
[Example 3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8oap7y2tnbnp24/ruelala_poster.pdf?dl=0)

### User Research Report
