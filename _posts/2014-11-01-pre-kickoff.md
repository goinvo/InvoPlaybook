Begins with a signed Statement of Work (SoW) from the client.

## Team 

### Immediately

If you haven't been a part of the sales process for the project then review the SoW and discuss the project with the Sales team to understand the background of the project and client. 

Spend 2 hours doing the following research to understand the industry, business, and team:
<ul>
	<li>Read the clients website</li>
	<li>Read the key stakeholders LinkedIn profiles</li>
	<li>Read the clients wikipedia page</li>
	<li>Read the latest news on the client and their product(s)</li>
	<li>Find any competitors and understand what they do differently</li>
</ul>



## Lead

### Immediately

Create an email listserv for the Invo team working on the project. Format should follow `clientname-internal@goinvo.com`. An example is `walgreens-internal@goinvo.com`. [Setup listserv with Google Groups](https://admin.google.com/goinvo.com/AdminHome?pli=1&fral=1#GroupList:). An admin of the Google Business account will need to set this up. Just ask if you need help.

[Add project](https://www.staffplan.com/projects/new) to StaffPlan. Check if the project already exists in StaffPlan, sometimes we'll do pre-planning of staff prior to a signed Statement of Work (SoW). Add all team members for the project and their planned hours for the duration of the project. If the client does not exist, then [add the client](https://www.staffplan.com/clients/new).

Setup Slack channel for the project. Channel name should follow `proj-client-name`. An example is `proj-dataxu`.  

Setup dropbox for internal team [following this structure]({% post_url 2014-04-01-dropbox %}). [Dropbox example](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4hqpdnf5nkquexu/AADJZTKqxU8hqhkZkCH8MWgva?dl=0).  

### Two Weeks before Kickoff

Schedule kickoff date(s) and times with the client. Also send over an agenda of kickoff (Agenda examples to be added).

Send client and stakeholders the kickoff survey and ask for this to be completed within 5 days. But first [duplicate this kickoff survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ii4KitXws0w85CLn_LQvLhOHL9p75dMMT2CCc0_iwwM/edit) and edit it for your project.

### One Week before Kickoff

Create Basecamp project. Project name should follow `ClientName: ProjectName` (ex. DataXu: Forecasting). An admin of Basecamp will need to set this up. Just ask if you need help.

Notify Invo person responsible for billing when the first and subsequent invoices should be sent to the client.
