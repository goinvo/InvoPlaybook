Begins with a signed Statement of Work (SoW) from the client.

## Research 

If you haven't been a part of the sales process for the project then review the SoW and discuss the project with the Sales team to understand the background of the project and client. 

Spend 2 hours doing the following research to understand the industry, business, and team:
<ul>
	<li>Read the clients website</li>
	<li>Read the key stakeholders LinkedIn profiles</li>
	<li>Read the clients wikipedia page</li>
	<li>Read the latest news on the client and their product(s)</li>
	<li>Find any competitors and understand what they do differently</li>
</ul>

## Setup

### Immediately

Create an email listserv for the Invo team working on the project. Format should follow `clientname-internal@goinvo.com`. An example is `walgreens-internal@goinvo.com`. [Setup listserv with Google Groups](https://admin.google.com/goinvo.com/AdminHome?pli=1&fral=1#GroupList:). An admin of the Google Business account will need to set this up. Just ask if you need help.

[Add project](https://www.staffplan.com/projects/new) to StaffPlan. Check if the project already exists in StaffPlan, sometimes we'll do pre-planning of staff prior to a signed Statement of Work (SoW). Add all team members for the project and their planned hours for the duration of the project. If the client does not exist, then [add the client](https://www.staffplan.com/clients/new).

Setup Slack channel for the project. Channel name should follow `proj-client-name`. An example is `proj-dataxu`.  

Setup dropbox for internal team [following this structure]({% post_url 2014-04-01-file-management %}). [Dropbox example](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4hqpdnf5nkquexu/AADJZTKqxU8hqhkZkCH8MWgva?dl=0).

Send kickoff agenda to the client.

```html
Subject: Kickoff Agenda, <dateTimeKickoff>

<clientName>,  

Here is our agenda for the project kickoff.
If you have any thoughts or edits, let us know.

Also, we have a survey we'd like you and your team to fill out prior to kickoff. We'll send the details over on <insertDaySent>.

<yourName>

---------

<includeAgenda>

```

Send client and stakeholders the [Kickoff Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/nxb978uXut) and ask for this to be completed within 2 days. Make sure you're sending this enough in advance where we'll have time to review the responses prior to kickoff. Here is an email template to send to the client. At this point, you may not know all the stakeholders, so sending to the client lead and asking to distribute to their team is fine.

``` html
Subject: Project Survey

<clientName>,  

Weâ€™d like to hear each person's perspective on the project prior to kickoff and then refine that into a single message during the kickoff.

Can you and your team individually fill out this 7 minute survey by <insertDeadline2businessDaysIdeal>?  
http://goo.gl/forms/nxb978uXut

Thanks,  
<yourName>
```

### One Week before Kickoff

Create Basecamp project. Project name should follow `ClientName: ProjectName` (ex. DataXu: Forecasting). An admin of Basecamp will need to set this up. Just ask if you need help.

### Invoicing
Get familiar with handling invoicing for the project.
<ul>
	<li>Read SoW terms for payment (# of invoices, dollar amount per invoice, when to send, payment net terms)</li>
	<li>Request billing contact information from client</li>
	<li>Identify dates for sending invoices and receiving payment. Let sales team know of those dates to update the financial forecast.</li>
	<li>Create invoice (workflow to be documented) and send to client billing contact on the pre-determined date.</li>
	<li>Add invoice to the dropbox folder `Invo_Projects` > `all_invoices` > `clientName` for our records. See the [Invoice Directory Structure section in File Management]({% post_url 2014-04-01-file-management %}) for more info.</li>
	<li>Follow up when a payment becomes late.</li>
</ul>
