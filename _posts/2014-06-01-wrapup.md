## Before the Project is Complete

### At 75% Completion of the Project

+ Identify the date of the completion date of the project
 + Take into account weeks that Invo did not work on the project due to holidays or vacation and any under/overburn.
 + It is useful to plan a few days of wrap-up after the final client meeting. Realistically there will be a few last minute changes the client requests.
+ Prepare a list of final deliverables which should include:
 + What Invo expects to complete by the end of the engagement
 + What Invo expects to have partially complete at the end of the engagement
 + What Invo expects to not have worked on at the end of the engagement.
+ During a regular meeting, reserve 15 minutes to discuss this list with the client. Get their feedback on the priority.
+ After discussing in person, send out an e-mail summarizing that information. Below is an example.

Hi all,
As we discussed today during our meeting, this project will be finishing on Friday, December 18. We will have our final meeting on December 16.
Based on the feedback from today's meeting, here is how we will focus during this last 4 weeks.

* Task 1 discussed at meeting
* Task 2 discussed at meeting
* Task 3 discussed at meeting.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ben

### 1 Week Before the Project is Complete

* Work out any final logistics of giving the clients the final deliverables.
* Communicate the types of deliverables to the client
 * This will allow them to ask any questions about these files.
 * Below is an example e-mail outlining the types of files.

```
Hi all,
We will be posting the final deliverables next Wednesday, and we are available for a wrap-up meeting next week Monday, Tuesday (except 2-3), or Wednesday.

As we have discussed, for the final deliverables, we will be providing:

* Style and functional guidelines in context of the component breakdown
reviewer and submitter workflows
* Final pngs and a link to final PSDs (most likely to large to post)
* Prototype code for the with 3 scenarios we outlined

Let us know your availability for a wrap-up meeting next week. 

Thank you, 
Jennifer
```

Generally, the deliverables for the project are outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). Here is the common list of deliverables and formats.

For Design Projects:

* Final PSD files
 * Layers should be cleanly grouped and labeled
* Final PNG files
 * Organized by workflow (or otherwise understandable)
* All weekly deliverables
 * While the client should already have these, it is helpful for them to have them in one place.
* All reports prepared during the project

For Projects involving Code

* All source code developed
* The final executables (if applicable)
* Instructions on how to deploy and build the application/code
* List of dependencies.
* Source code should be well documented.
* For production applications, it is helpful to include a directory structure outline.


### On the Final Day of the Project

* Deliver all deliverables to the client. Include with these a description of all the deliverables and any notes about them.
 * Here is an example e-mail outlining this information:

```
Hello, 

Our engagement with ACME ended last week. This week we were finishing up a Web Based User Interface Design Guide for ACME. The design guide is made up of 3 sections – Principles, Process and Examples. 

To close out our engagement, we have included all the final deliverables in a dropbox folder that includes the following:

* Prototypes: The code for the prototypes we developed during the engagement.
* Web Design Guide: The HTML and CSS for the design guide we prepared.
* User Reearch Report: including all of our findings from the user research.
* Product Ecosystem diagram 
* Screen designs which we have delivered throughout the engagement

Thanks and we look forward to working with you again.

## After the Project is Complete
### Tasks for the Team
#### Within 1 Business Day of Project Completion
Entire team completes [Invo Exit Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/N6MZHjiOL3).

Entire team pulls together a handful of the best designs, sketches, and photos to be used for marketing materials. Place logically named images in `dropbox` > `Graphics` > `Portfolio` > `<clientName>`.


### Tasks for the Lead
#### Within 1 Business Day of Project Completion
Send final invoice for the project to the client’s billing department.

#### Within 2 Business Days of Project Completion
Send each person from the client team the [Client Exit Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/jge3n36Lh1). Here is an email template to individually send to each person from the client team. Optional: Make the message more personal by acknowledging the contribution that person added to the project.

``` html
<clientName>,  

We'd like to get your honest feedback on how Invo did for the project.  
Can you fill out this 5 minute survey by tomorrow?

Thanks,  
<yourName>
```

#### Within 3 Business Days of Project Completion
Complete [Marketing Material Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/SfoP7uYVzR).

#### Within 5 Business Days of Project Completion
Review all Exit Survey responses from the [client](https://docs.google.com/a/goinvo.com/spreadsheets/d/1p1QHnFSGsIxQThGMqmQFsbpqUmlYuy04omzCriQd6Gk/edit#gid=290826126) and [Invo](https://docs.google.com/a/goinvo.com/spreadsheets/d/1p1QHnFSGsIxQThGMqmQFsbpqUmlYuy04omzCriQd6Gk/edit#gid=290826126) and present any interesting findings to the project, leadership, and sales team.

#### Send out a Summary of the Project to boston@goinvo.com
Now that the project is complete, take a few minutes to summarize what work Invo did during the project. Summarize it in an e-mail to the full studio.

Today we are wrapping up our latest gig with ACME Corporation.

Reshma, Eric and I started working with ACME at the start of February and we've had 2-3 people working on research, design, prototyping, and production code for most of the time since then. 

In the first part of the engagement, Eric led an effort to help ACME re-envision the future of their platform and identify an approach for a scheduled rollout which will take place over the next 2-3 years. To help validate the design and sell the new vision internally and externally, Ivan and I built a series of prototypes which they are still using today to sell their future to important customers.

Danny and Michael began work on in July on the first set of production code. In addition to executing on the design vision, they have worked with ACME to define the next technology stack(Angular as a client side MVC separated from their API server) that will be used on all their future UI development. They did a good job of involving the UI dev team in the large architectural decisions. Despite the project being understaffed from ACME's side, Michael and Danny were able to deliver a top-notch experience.

Feedback on the new screen from some of ACME's bigger customers has been very positive thus far and the Product team is very excited about what this new screen will provide. Additionally the team we have been working with have universally echoed the sentiment that this project has been one of the smoothest that they have worked on.

Here are links to a few videos of the app on the demo environment. I have also attached some screenshots of the before and after.

Congrats to all that have been involved with ACME over the last 8 months.

#### 3 to 6 Months After the Project is Complete

If it makes sense, consider reaching out to the client 3 to 6 months after the project has ended. Ask them how things are going and get some feedback about the work (after they have had more time to really digest and stress test the work we've done).
