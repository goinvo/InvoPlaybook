### Default Project Directory Structure

``` html
/Invo_Projects	 
  /ClientName	 
    /client	 
      /background 	
      /research	 
    /design	 
      /deliverables	 
      /production	 
      /research	 
```

`Invo_Projects` directory containing every project we work on.

`ClientName` directory containing the project for a specific client.

`client` directory containing all material received from the client. It's helpful to place  material received via email, basecamp, etc, in dropbox for a central, local location for all.

`background` directory containing any information to understand the business, industry, product. This may include presenations, spreadsheets.

`research` directory containing any research done by the client.

`design` directory containing all material created by Invo.

`deliverables` directory containing all material we've delivered to the client. Typically PDFs, but can also include spreadsheets, PSDs, and other documents that make sense.

`production` directory containing files used to create our deliverables. 

`research` directory containing research Invo has done.

      /research	 
    /design	 
      /deliverables	 
      /production	 
      /research	 
```

      /deliverables	 
      /production
