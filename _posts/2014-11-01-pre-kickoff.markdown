## Lead

1-2 weeks before kickoff, send client and stakeholders the kickoff survey. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ii4KitXws0w85CLn_LQvLhOHL9p75dMMT2CCc0_iwwM/edit)  
Create email list for the invo team working on the project:  (get someone to edit)`%client-name%-internal@goinvo.com` (ex. walgreens-internal@goinvo.com)  
Start a new basecamp project. Name it `client-name: product-name` (ex. DataXu: Forecasting). (get someone to edit  
Setup dropbox for internal team and client (if necessary). Clients get their own directory within `Invo_Projects`. Example; `Invo_Projects/CodeRyte`. If clients have multiple projects, then create a directory for that project within the client. Example; `Invo_Projects/DataXu/Create_Campaign`. All projects should use this directory structure found in dropbox at Invo_Projects/Invo_Project_Directory_Template.  
Setup channel for the project within Slack. Name `proj-client-name`. Example `proj-dataxu`.  
Project lead notifies Invo person responsible for billing the first invoice that it can be sent to the client.  
Setup kickoff date(s) and times 10 days before project start.  
Review SOW (internal handoff with sales)  
Start new github repo (if applicable)
