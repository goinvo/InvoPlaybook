* 1 carrot
* pinch sea salt
* 2 15 oz cans black-eyed peas

In a skillet with a lid, simmer veggies with a pinch of sea salt and 1/2 cup water until just tender. Add the black-eyed peas and barbecue sauce to a pot and simmer, covered, for about 5 minutes.

In a juicer, juice the kale, spinach, kiwi, and apple(s). Add the mixture to a blender with the banana and puree. The banana needs to go in the blender because it’s too mushy for a juicer.

Soak the cashews in water for 2 hours. After the cashews have soacked, throw all the ingredients into a blender and puree for 1 minute.


##Dessert

### Flour-less Chocolate Cake
(Sara Berndt)

* 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips or semi-sweet chocolate, roughly chopped (I use semi)
* 2 sticks butter, cut into chunks
* 1 1/4 cup sugar
* 6 eggs
* 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 tablespoon milk
* Splash of pure vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 375. Melt the butter and chocolate in a saucepan on the stove slowly adding the sugar to the melted mixture until smooth. In another bowl crack the 6 eggs adding coco powder and milk and stir in the chocolate when melted. Stir until smooth, no lumps. Add mix to a greased shallow dish and bake for 35 minutes or until “toothpick test” comes out clean. Wait until cake is completely cooled to lift out of dish. Add fruit or powdered sugar for garnish.
