## Basics

### Naming Deliverable 	
At the bottom of every document, include the client name, project name, deliverable name, version number, Invo team names (alpha order of last name), date (format `19.Feb.15` which InDesign automates for you using the documents last modified date), and Invo logo.

### Numbering and Naming Screens 	
If there are multiple screens or ideas within a page then each screen or idea should be numbered and named appropriately. Numbering helps people identify which comp to look or are referencing on the page. Naming helps people understand what that comp is generally about.

### Annotating Screens	
It's helpful to annotate your documents so others can understand the details behind the images and to guide people through the workflow.

### Comp Template 	
This Adobe InDesign template includes the styles (paragraph + object styles) to mark up deliverables: labels, annotations, and branding.

## Common Deliverables

### Pre-Kickoff

#### Project Proposal
Project proposals are sent to a potential client we're in discussions working with. The proposal provides background on the company, the team, and what the design process and schedule could look like for the project, and cost. The proposal starts the conversation to refine the engagement and ultimately create a Statement of Work (SoW).

#### Statement of Work (SoW)
The Statement of Work outlines our engagement with the client. It describes what the project is about, the weekly schedule, deliverables, team size, and cost. To begin the project, the client will need to agree to and sign the SoW.

### Kickoff

#### Schedule
Every project has a schedule and should be roughly based on the Statement of Work: goals and duration. During the kickoff is where the schedule should be finely detailed with the client. It should state clearly what is delivered each week until the end of the project.

#### Project + Product Spec
Describes the project and product in a short 1-2 pager. This document has 3 main sections: Vision, Background, Goals. Each section has a specific description for the project and product. 	

First draft is created based on the [client kickoff survey responses](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/cory-zue/0/692/85). During the kickoff we'll use that draft as a converstation starter to flesh out a v01 that all stakeholders agree to. This guides our purpose throughout the project. This is subject to evolve over time, so this document may need to be revised.

#### Product Questions

### Ongoing

#### Market Research 	
TBD

#### Needs Map

#### Pixel Perfect Comps 	
Exact perfection in UI details. These comps will provide guidance and the assets for a UI Engineer to align the software with. Whenever handing PSDs to others, make sure the layers are appropriately named and organized.

[PSD Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94x17023dtjlvli/Concept_Studio_Design_v35.psd?dl=0)

#### Presentations 	
At times, we create specific presentations tailored to the clients needs. Sometimes we present to key project stakeholders, clients customers, or the entire company.

#### Process Map
Maps out the process of the service. This could map out all parts of the process, even if we're not designing it, because we should know the entire lifecycle of a person using the service. 	
[PDF Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmvx4pj45h1b5bs/mountsinai_caas_process_v03.pdf?dl=0)

#### Product Ecosystem
Inventory of all the clients products plus their relationships and overlaps between products. 	
[PDF Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxu5ngum8kc4i0v/Empirix_product_ecosystem_v2.pdf?dl=0)

#### Product Blueprint
[PDF Example 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mkarx47fs8kfbmi/SmashFly_blueprint_v2.pdf?dl=0)

#### Prototype
A demo of part(s) of the software we're designing. Highly iterative. Each prototype should have a clear intention to test. Prototype formats can vary based on needs but can be: Keynote, Flinto, HTML, Native. 	
TBD

#### Production Code
Using our designs, we'll work with the client to develop the new software. 	
TBD

#### Sketches
Sometimes we'll share our sketches if we're looking for quick feedback and have not yet started to digitally create the concepts.

[PDF Example 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ygduciwalvqzsm/mountsinai_caas_admin_draft.pdf?dl=0)

#### System Diagram
High-level architecting of the main components of the service, relationships, and actions.

#### UI Workflows
Many of our deliverables are UI Workflows. These show the screens, how people will use the software through a series or screens, and any details to describe the experience.

[PDF Example 3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8oap7y2tnbnp24/ruelala_poster.pdf?dl=0)

#### User Research Report
TBD


### Ending

#### Implementation Analysis
Details an estimated effort to build the design we're working on. Includes amount + type of people, time, and releases. Typically created towards the end of the project where we'll have a good sense of the product. This exercise takes about 2-3 days internally and then we'll review with the client and their engineering team. It's expected to have a revision or two based on feedback.
