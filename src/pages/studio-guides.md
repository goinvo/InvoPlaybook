## How to Onboard

Onboarding is driven by a designated Sherpa. As a studio, we are all accountable to make sure each new hire has a Sherpa to help them through their first few weeks. The first day experience is fully impacted by how the Sherpa looks out for new hire, so we take this very seriously. All of the following should be done by the Sherpa.



**Sherpa Tips**

- Ask “do you have any questions?” X 100  
- Be visibly available  
- Help newbie manage their time
- If you provide reading for the newbie, follow up and ask about it


**Pre-Arrival**

- Reach out to see if they have any questions and provide expectations for Day 1
- Set up email @goinvo.com (Juhan, Eric)
- Create accounts for  Staffplan, Slack, Dropbox, Github, Basecamp (Juhan, Eric)
- Purchase any additional software licenses: Sketch, Adobe Creative Cloud (Juhan, Eric)
- Find out which project they will be on and who they should talk to on day one

## Evolving our Site

So you’ve got a grand idea for the website or playbook? Here are a few practical steps (from the project management perspective) to make the change.


Note: if it’s a minor change like adding a new hire’s bio, fixing a typo, switching out an image - just discuss it in Slack and do it.


**Prep**

![github_project_step1](/images/github_project_step1.png)
1. Make a Project in GitHub that lists why the change is important and scopes out basic steps to completion and deadlines. To make a project, open the goinvo.com or playbook repo → navigate to the Projects tab → click New Project (see image above). 

![github_project_step2](/images/github_project_step2.png) 
2. A GitHub Project can help you to manage tasks and clearly state a mission and timeline. Here is an example of how you can set it up (see image above). In the menu, you can copy [this template](https://docs.google.com/a/wecreategoodness.com/document/d/1qmDXJV_pXpLQkgXlMtDXXw2HUvmvqilbp-RMzBNZLD4/edit?usp=sharing) to outline the mission and timeline.  
3. Mark your name on weekly Techtalk calendar so that you can get the group’s perspective


**Techtalk**

1. Give a short presentation to explain your idea (length 5 - 10 min can depend on how big of a change it would be).
2.  Give everyone a chance to discuss then take a vote (Ye or Ne).
3. If the consensus is Yes, determine who will be a part of the project. Who will lead Engineering, Design, Signoff.  


**Work**

1. Use the Github project to keep track of tasks to be completed and deadlines.  
2. If the project lasts for more than 2 weeks, give short updates every other week during techtalk time.
3.  Give a talk at the end of the project as well. The website represents all of us, so it’s important that everyone is included.  


Suggestions for success:

- Take a “design” approach → understand your users, brainstorm, test ideas and screens.  
- Read through this doc [Design Principles Invo Site4.0](https://docs.google.com/a/wecreategoodness.com/document/d/18NHIlAlyYU54HeGCCdGCPAfDWHDV_LeE9I4naqyjFeA/edit?usp=sharing) which holds research about potential client users, potential hire users, and competitor’s sites.
- Design mobile first!  
- Rip off the bandaid when it comes to getting feedback. Show your work often!  
- Validate your design (via feedback and testing) before valuable time is spent on engineering
